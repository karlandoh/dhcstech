# DHCSTech React Landing Page

This is a [landing page](https://dhcstech.vercel.app) for DHCSTECH cybersecurity company. This company has multiple partnerships, one being [DialPad](https://www.dialpad.com/). Through phone, email and Cisco Webex meetings, I ensured that the site was able to recieve request from potential clients, and be aesthetically pleasing at the same time. The executives of DCHSTECH were very satisfied with how the website turned out.

I then attached a subset of their domain to the github repository.
